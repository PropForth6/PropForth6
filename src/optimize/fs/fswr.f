\ fs - eeprom file system
\
\ A very simple file system for eeprom. The goal is not a general file system, but a place to put text
\ (or code) in eeprom so it can be dynamically loaded by propforth
\
\ the eeprom area start is defined by fsbot and the top is defined by fstop
\ The files are in eeprom memory as such:
\ 2 bytes - length of the contents of the file
\ 1 byte	- length of the file name (this is a normal counted string, counted strings can be up
\		255 bytes in length, the length here is limited for space reasons)
\ 1 - 31 bytes	- the file name
\ 0 - 65534 bytes	- the contents of the file
\
\ the last file has a length of 65535 (0hFFFF)
\ 
\ the start of every file is aligned with eeprom pages, for efficient read and write, this is 64 bytes
\
\ Status: 2010NOV24 Beta
\
\ 2011FEB03 - fix to align page reads to page addresses so crossing eeproms does not cause a problem (fsread)
\
\ 2011MAY31 - stable, reformat, updated error codes, added error message for file not found, added RO option

\
\ main routines
\
\ fsload filename	- reads filename and directs it to the next free forth cog, every additional nested fsload
\			  requires an additional free cog
\ fsread filename	- reads the file and echos it directly to the terminal
\ fswrite filename	- writes the file to the filesystem - takes input from the input until ...\0x0d is encounterd
\			- ie 3 dots followed by a carriage return
\ fsls			- lists the files
\ fsclear		- erases all files
\ fsdrop		- erases the last file
\
\
\ The most common problem is forgetting the ...\h0d at the end of the file you want to write. Usually an fsdrop will
\ erase the last file which is invalid.
