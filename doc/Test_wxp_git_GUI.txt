OK, I downloaded https://git-scm.com/download/win

checked out my branch 20160619_DOS_scripts

but got a detached head error. Deleted local directory and started over.

Secnd time, message said resolve with "create from detached head",
so I gave it a new name  20160801_WXP_dos_scripts

So i can work here and push it to main.

I guess this idea is to have one branch on the linux box (20160801_WXP_dos_scripts)
and a separrate branch on the winodws box (0160619_DOS_scripts)
